# LearningPython

This repository is a collection of my personal notes which I have taken during learning basics of Python from various online resources. The main contributor of those resources
is the **Python for Research** course by HarvardX on edX.

The first notebook covers the basics of python syntax, types of objects and datatypes in Python and how Python interprets the code. The second notebook dwelves into the usage of mathematical 
modules like Numpy, tensorflow and Matplotlib.
